# GSAP Learning Journey ðŸŽ¥âœ¨

Welcome to my **GSAP Learning Journey**! This repository is a collection of my experiments, creative snippets, and animation demos as I explore the powerful capabilities of the [GreenSock Animation Platform (GSAP)](https://greensock.com/). From simple animations to more complex sequences, this is where I practice, learn, and grow as a developer and animator.

## About the Repo

This repository is a space where I document my progress and share code examples of the animations I create with GSAP. Whether you're learning GSAP yourself or just curious to see what it can do, I hope you find these examples helpful and inspiring.

## What is GSAP?

GSAP, or GreenSock Animation Platform, is a high-performance JavaScript library for creating rich, engaging web animations. It's used by developers and designers around the world to bring websites to life with animations like:

- Smooth page transitions
- Eye-catching scrolling effects
- Animated illustrations
- And much more!

You can learn more about GSAP and its features by visiting the [official website](https://greensock.com/).
